# 0.2.1

Includes a fix where wq/wqa could exit before file saving completed.

# 0.2.0

Enough has changed to bump the version. We're skipping 0.1.x because
previously the CLI would always report version as 0.1.0, and we'd like
to distinguish it in bug reports..

  on cargo run. `~/.config/helix/runtime` can also be used.
- Registers can now be selected via " (for example `"ay`)

- A per-file LSP symbol picker was added to space+s
- Selection can be replaced with yanked text via R

- `1g` now correctly goes to line 1
- `ctrl-i` now correctly jumps backwards in history
- A small memory leak was fixed, where we tried to reuse tree-sitter
  query cursors, but always allocated a new one
- Auto-formatting is now only on for certain languages
- The root directory is now provided in LSP initialization, fixing
  certain language servers (typescript)
- LSP failing to start no longer panics
- Elixir language queries were fixed

# 0.0.10

Keymaps:
- Add mappings to jump to diagnostics
