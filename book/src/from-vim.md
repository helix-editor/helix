# Migrating from Vim

Helix's editing model is strongly inspired from Vim and Kakoune, and a notable
difference from Vim (and the most striking similarity to Kakoune) is that Helix
follows the `selection â†’ action` model. This means that the whatever you are
going to act on (a word, a paragraph, a line, etc) is selected first and the
action itself (delete, change, yank, etc) comes second. A cursor is simply a
single width selection.
