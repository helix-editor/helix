# Language Support

The following languages and Language Servers are supported. To use
Language Server features, you must first [configure][lsp-config-wiki] the
appropriate Language Server.

You can check the language support in your installed helix version with `hx --health`.

Also see the [Language Configuration][lang-config] docs and the [Adding
Languages][adding-languages] guide for more language configuration information.
