## Using pickers

Helix has a variety of pickers, which are interactive windows used to select various kinds of items. These include a file picker, global search picker, and more. Most pickers are accessed via keybindings in [space mode](./keymap.md#space-mode). Pickers have their own [keymap](./keymap.md#picker) for navigation.

### Filtering Picker Results

Most pickers perform fuzzy matching using [fzf syntax](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf?tab=readme-ov-file#search-syntax). Two exceptions are the global search picker, which uses regex, and the workspace symbol picker, which passes search terms to the LSP.

If a picker shows multiple columns, you may apply the filter to a specific column by prefixing the column name with `%`. Column names can be shortened to any prefix, so `%p`, `%pa` or `%pat` all mean the same as `%path`. For example, `helix %p .toml$ !lang` searches for the term "helix" within files with paths ending in ".toml" but not including "lang".

Note that the [current selection register](./registers.md#special-registers) can be used to insert the text of the current selection using `Ctrl-r`-`.`. In addition, the global search picker will use the contents of the [search register](./registers.md#default-registers) if you press `Enter` without typing a filter. For example, pressing `*`-`Space-/`-`Enter` will start a global search for the currently selected text.
