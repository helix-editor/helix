# Digraphs

By default, special characters can be input using the `insert_digraphs` (or `C-K`) command while in insert mode. Custom digraphs can be added to the `editor.digraphs` section of the config:

```toml
[editor.digraphs]
ka = "か"
ku = { symbols = "く", description = "The japanese character Ku" }
shrug = "¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
```

## Defaults

TBD
