# Installing Helix

To install Helix, follow the instructions specific to your operating system.
Note that:

- To get the latest nightly version of Helix, you need to
  [build from source](./building-from-source.md).

- To take full advantage of Helix, install the language servers for your
  preferred programming languages. See the
  [wiki](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/wiki/How-to-install-the-default-language-servers)
  for instructions.

## Pre-built binaries

Download pre-built binaries from the
[GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/releases). Add the binary to your system's `$PATH` to use it from the command
line.
