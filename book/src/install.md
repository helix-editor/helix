To install Helix, follow the instructions specific to your operating system.
Additionally:

- To get the latest pre-release version of Helix, you will need to
  [build from source](#building-from-source).

- To take full advantage of Helix, install the language servers for your
  preferred programming languages. Refer to the
  [Helix Wiki](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/wiki/How-to-install-the-default-language-servers)
  for detailed instructions.

## Using the Pre-built Binaries

Download pre-built binaries from the
[GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/releases). You will
need to add the binary to your system's `$PATH` to access it from the command
line.

## Installing Helix on Linux through the Official Package Manager

If your Linux distribution has Helix available through its official package
manager, install it through that. The following shows availability
throughout the Linux ecosystem:

## Installing Helix on Linux via Third-Party Repositories

If Helix is not available through your distribution's official repository, use a
third-party repository.

### Ubuntu

Helix is available for the following versions of Ubuntu:

- 20.04 LTS (Focal Fossa)
- 22.04 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish)
- 22.10 (Kinetic Kudu)

Via [Maveonair's PPA](https://launchpad.net/~maveonair/+archive/ubuntu/helix-editor)

```sh
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:maveonair/helix-editor
sudo apt update
sudo apt install helix
```

### Fedora/RHEL Linux

Helix is available via `copr`:

```sh
sudo dnf copr enable varlad/helix
sudo dnf install helix
```

### Arch Linux Community

Releases are available in the community repository. Additionally, a
[helix-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/helix-git/) package is available
in the AUR, which builds the master branch.

### NixOS

Helix is available as a [flake](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes) in the project
root. Use `nix develop` to spin up a reproducible development shell. Outputs are
cached for each push to master using [Cachix](https://www.cachix.org/). The
flake is configured to automatically make use of this cache assuming the user
accepts the new settings on first use.

If you are using a version of Nix without flakes enabled,
[install Cachix CLI](https://docs.cachix.org/installation) and use
`cachix use helix` to configure Nix to use cached outputs when possible.

## Installing Helix on macOS via Homebrew

Helix is available in Homebrew Core:

```sh
brew install helix
```

## Installing Helix on Windows

Install on Windows using [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/), [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/)
or [MSYS2](https://msys2.org/).

**Scoop:**

```sh
scoop install helix
```

**Chocolatey:**

```sh
choco install helix
```

**MSYS2:**

For 64-bit Windows 8.1 or above:

```sh
pacman -S mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-helix
```

2. Compile Helix:

1. Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/helix-editor/helix
cd helix
```

2. Compile Helix:

```sh
cargo install --path helix-term --locked
```

This command will create the `hx` executable and construct the tree-sitter
grammars in the `runtime` folder, or in the folder specified in `HELIX_RUNTIME`
(as described below).

> ðŸ’¡ If you are using the musl-libc instead of glibc the following environment variable must be set during the build
> to ensure tree sitter grammars can be loaded correctly:
>
> ```sh
> RUSTFLAGS="-C target-feature=-crt-static"
> ```

3. Configure Helix's runtime files

**IMPORTANT**: The runtime files must be accessible to the newly created binary.
They are currently located in the source code `runtime` directory. To make them
accessible, you must follow the instructions for your operating system:

> ðŸ’¡ Tree-sitter grammars can be fetched and compiled if not pre-packaged. Fetch
> grammars with `hx --grammar fetch` (requires `git`) and compile them with
> `hx --grammar build` (requires a C++ compiler).

- Linux and macOS

Either,

1. Set the `HELIX_RUNTIME` environment variable on your system to tell Helix
   where to find the runtime files.

   Use the `HELIX_RUNTIME=/path/to/helix/runtime` format, for example:
   `HELIX_RUNTIME=/home/user-name/src/helix/runtime`. Add this variable to your
   `~/.bashrc` file or equivalent to persist it.

Or,

2. Create a symlink in `~/.config/helix` that links to the source code
   directory.

   ```sh
   ln -s $PWD/runtime ~/.config/helix/runtime
   ```

And optionally:

3. Configure the Desktop Shortcut

If your desktop environment supports the
[XDG desktop menu](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/menu-spec/menu-spec-latest.html)
you can configure Helix to show up in the application menu by copying the
provided `.desktop` and icon files to their correct folders:

```sh
cp contrib/Helix.desktop ~/.local/share/applications
cp contrib/helix.png ~/.local/share/icons
```

To use another terminal than the system default, you can modify the `.desktop`
file. For example, to use `kitty`:

```sh
sed -i "s|Exec=hx %F|Exec=kitty hx %F|g" ~/.local/share/applications/Helix.desktop
sed -i "s|Terminal=true|Terminal=false|g" ~/.local/share/applications/Helix.desktop
```

- Windows

Either,

1. Set the `HELIX_RUNTIME` environment variable on your system to tell Helix
   where to find the runtime files.

   You can either do this using the Windows setting (search for
   `Edit environment variables for your account`) or use the `setx` command in
   Cmd:

   ```sh
   setx HELIX_RUNTIME "%userprofile%\source\repos\helix\runtime"
   ```

   > ðŸ’¡ `%userprofile%` resolves to your user directory like
   > `C:\Users\Your-Name\` for example.

Or,

2. Create a symlink in `%appdata%\helix\` that links to the source code
   directory.

   | Method     | Command                                                                                |
   | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | PowerShell | `New-Item -ItemType SymbolicLink -Target "runtime" -Path "$Env:AppData\helix\runtime"` |
   | Cmd        | `cd %appdata%\helix` <br/> `mklink /D runtime "%userprofile%\src\helix\runtime"`       |

   > ðŸ’¡ On Windows, creating a symbolic link may require running PowerShell or
   > Cmd as an administrator.

## Validating the Installation

To make sure everything is set up as expected you should run the Helix health
check:

```sh
hx --health
```

For more information on the health check results refer to
[Health check](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/wiki/Healthcheck).
