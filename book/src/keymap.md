### Search

Search commands all operate on the `/` register by default. Use `"<char>` to operate on a different one.

| Key   | Description                                 | Command              |

| `N`   | Select previous search match                | `search_prev`        |
| `*`   | Use current selection as the search pattern | `search_selection`   |

### Minor modes

These sub-modes are accessible from normal mode and typically switch back to normal mode after a command.

#### View mode

View mode is intended for scrolling and manipulating the view without changing
the selection. The "sticky" variant of this mode is persistent; use the Escape
key to return to normal mode after usage (useful when you're simply looking
over text and not actively editing it).

#### Window mode

## Insert Mode

We support many readline/emacs style bindings in insert mode for
convenience. These can be helpful for making simple modifications
without escaping to normal mode, but beware that you will not have an
undo-able "save point" until you return to normal mode.

## Select / extend mode

This mode echoes Normal mode, but changes any movements to extend
selections rather than replace them. Goto motions are also changed to
extend, so that `vgl` for example extends the selection to the end of
the line.

Search is also affected. By default, `n` and `N` will remove the current
selection and select the next instance of the search term. Toggling this
mode before pressing `n` or `N` makes it possible to keep the current
selection. Toggling it on and off during your iterative searching allows
you to selectively add search terms to your selections.
