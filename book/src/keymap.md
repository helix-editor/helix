### Minor modes

These sub-modes are accessible from normal mode and typically switch back to normal mode after a command.

#### View mode

View mode is intended for scrolling and manipulating the view without changing
the selection. The "sticky" variant of this mode is persistent; use the Escape
key to return to normal mode after usage (useful when you're simply looking
over text and not actively editing it).

in [Usage](./usage.md) for an explanation about [surround](./usage.md#surround)
and [textobject](./usage.md#textobject) usage.

#### Window mode

This layer is similar to vim keybindings as kakoune does not support window.

| Key                    | Description                    | Command           |
| -----                  | -------------                  | -------           |

| `q`, `Ctrl-q`          | Close current window           | `wclose`          |
| `o`, `Ctrl-o`          | Only keep the current window, closing all the others            | `wonly`           |

#### Space mode

This layer is a kludge of mappings, mostly pickers.


| Key     | Description                                                           | Command                             |

| `S`     | Open workspace symbol picker (**LSP**)                                | `workspace_symbol_picker`           |

| `w`     | Enter [window mode](#window-mode)                                     | N/A                                 |

> TIP: Global search displays results in a fuzzy picker, use `space + '` to bring it back up after opening a file.
 
#### Unimpaired

Mappings in the style of [vim-unimpaired](https://github.com/tpope/vim-unimpaired).

| Key      | Description                                  | Command             |
| -----    | -----------                                  | -------             |
| `[d`     | Go to previous diagnostic (**LSP**)          | `goto_prev_diag`    |
| `]d`     | Go to next diagnostic (**LSP**)              | `goto_next_diag`    |
| `[D`     | Go to first diagnostic in document (**LSP**) | `goto_first_diag`   |

| `[space` | Add newline above                            | `add_newline_above` |
| `]space` | Add newline below                            | `add_newline_below` |

## Insert Mode

| Key      | Description           | Command                |
| -----    | -----------           | -------                |
| `Escape` | Switch to normal mode | `normal_mode`          |
| `Ctrl-x` | Autocomplete          | `completion`           |
| `Ctrl-w` | Delete previous word  | `delete_word_backward` |

## Select / extend mode

I'm still pondering whether to keep this mode or not. It changes movement
commands (including goto) to extend the existing selection instead of replacing it.

> NOTE: It's a bit confusing at the moment because extend hasn't been
> implemented for all movement commands yet.
