<!-- Link Website and documentation here?-->

The editing model is very heavily based on kakoune; during development I found
myself agreeing with most of kakoune's design decisions. For more information, see the [website](https://helix-editor.com) or
[documentation](https://docs.helix-editor.com/).

All shortcuts/keymaps can be found [in the documentation on the website](https://docs.helix-editor.com/keymap.html).

## üéÅ Features

- Vim-like modal editing
- Multiple selections
- Built-in language server support
- Smart, incremental syntax highlighting and code editing via tree-sitter

It's a terminal-based editor first, but I'd like to explore a custom renderer
(similar to emacs) in wgpu or skulpin. See [#39](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/issues/39) for more info.

## üì¶ Installation 
> Note: Some platforms require extra configuration for syntax highlighting. See [runtime](#runtime).

> The binaries name has been shortened to `hx`

#### Binary
Pre-build binaries are available on the [releases page](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/releases).

#### From Source / Windows

```
git clone --recurse-submodules --shallow-submodules -j8 https://github.com/helix-editor/helix
cd helix
cargo install --path helix-term
```

This will install the `hx` binary to `$HOME/.cargo/bin`.

#### Linux
Download via a package:
> Note: Setting up runtime is not required. Packages wrap the `hx` binary with a
>  wrapper that sets the HELIX_RUNTIME variable to the install directory.

[![Packaging status](https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/helix.svg)](https://repology.org/project/helix/versions)

#### MacOS
Helix can be installed on MacOS through homebrew via:

```
brew tap helix-editor/helix
brew install helix
```

#### [Runtime](#runtime)
Helix requires runtime files for syntax highlighting and themes. Make sure to copy/symlink the `runtime/` directory into your config directory.

> The runtime directory is included with binaries or will be downloaded with the source code.

| OS | Path |
| ---| --- |
| Linux & MacOS | ~/.config/helix/ |
| Windows | Appdata/Roaming/Helix |

For example: `~/.config/helix/runtime`

#### Notes
> Only certain languages have indentation definitions at the moment. Check
`runtime/queries/<lang>/` for `indents.toml`.

> The runtime directory can be overriden via the `HELIX_RUNTIME` environment variable.

> Running via cargo also doesn't require setting explicit `HELIX_RUNTIME` path, it will automatically
> detect the `runtime` directory in the project root.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

#### Missing syntax highlighting and themes?

Follow the steps in the [install guide](#runtime) to setup your runtime.

#### LSP isn't working?

Is the LSP server (E.g. `rust-analyzer`) in your `$PATH`?

Try starting helix with the `-v` flag and checking the log file (`~/.cache/helix/helix.log`) for LSP related messages.

#### Failed to execute C compiler (building from source)

Both a C and a C++ compiler need to be installed.

 
## ‚ù§Ô∏è Contributing Ô∏è

Contributors are very welcome! **No contribution is too small and all contributions are valued!**

Some suggestions to get started:

- You can look at the [good first issue](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/labels/E-easy) label on the issue tracker.
- Help with packaging on various distributions needed!
- To use print debugging to the `~/.cache/helix/helix.log` file, you must:
  * Print using `log::info!`, `warn!`, or `error!`. (`log::info!("helix!")`)
  * Use the parameter (`hx -v <file>`) to increase log verbosity. Increase the `v's` for more info, `hx -vvv` being most verbose.
- If your preferred language is missing, integrating a tree-sitter grammar for
    it and defining syntax highlight queries for it is straight forward and
    doesn't require much knowledge of the internals.

We provide an [architecture.md](./docs/architecture.md) that should give you
a good overview of the internals.
