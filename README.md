My "daily driver" build of [the Helix editor](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix).

I test-drive PRs from the upstream repository and hack on fixes/features on this branch.
PRs are usually squash-merged and logged as `(<PR number>) short description` to avoid GitHub auto-links.
This branch is very unstable (more panics and unpolished behaviors) and is force-pushed frequently:
use it with caution.
