//! This modules encapsulates a tiny bit of unsafe code that
//! makes diffing significantly faster and more ergonomic to implement.
//! This code is necessary because diffing requires quick random
//! access to the lines of the text that is being diffed.
//!
//! Therefore it is best to collect the `Rope::lines` iterator into a vec
//! first because access to the vec is `O(1)` where `Rope::line` is `O(log N)`.
//! However this process can allocate a (potentially quite large) vector.
//!
//! To avoid reallocation for every diff, the vector is reused.
//! However the RopeSlice references the original rope and therefore forms a self-referential data structure.
//! A transmute is used to change the lifetime of the slice to static to circumvent that project.
