# we use tokio_unstable to enable runtime::Handle::id so we can separate
# globals from multiple parallel tests. If that function ever does get removed
# its possible to replace (with some additional overhead and effort)
# Annoyingly build.rustflags doesn't work here because it gets overwritten
# if people have their own global target.<..> config (for example to enable mold)
# specifying flags this way is more robust as they get merged
# This still gets overwritten by RUST_FLAGS though, luckily it shouldn't be necessary
# to set those most of the time. If downstream does overwrite this its not a huge
# deal since it will only break tests anyway
