                 Welcome to the Helix tutorial!
        Press the j key until you reach the introduction.



=================================================================
=                        INTRODUCTION                           =
=================================================================
                                                                 
 Welcome to the Helix editor! Helix is different from editors
 you might be used to in that it is modal, meaning that it has
 different modes for editing text. The primary modes you will
 use are Normal mode and Insert mode. While in Normal mode, the
 keys you type won't actually type text. Instead, they will
 perform various actions with the text. This allows for more
 efficient editing. This tutor will teach you how you can make
 use of Helix's modal editing features. To begin, ensure your
 CapsLock key is not pressed and hold the j key until you reach
 the first lesson.








=================================================================
=                  1.1 BASIC CURSOR MOVEMENT                    =
=================================================================

          ↑
          k       * h is on the left
      ← h   l →   * l is on the right
          j       * j looks like a down arrow
          ↓

 The cursor can be moved using the h, j, k, l keys, as shown
 above. The cursor / arrow keys will also work, but it is faster
 to use the hjkl keys as they are closer to the other keys you
 will be using. Try moving around to get a feel for hjkl.
 Once you're ready, hold j to continue to the next lesson.







=================================================================
=                      1.2 EXITING HELIX                        =
=================================================================

 1. Type : to enter Command mode. Your cursor will
    move to the bottom of the screen.
 2. Type q or quit and press Enter to exit Helix.

 Note: The quit command will fail if there are unsaved changes.
       To force quit and DISCARD these changes, type q! or quit!.
       You will learn how to save files later.

 To exit Command mode without entering a command, press Escape.

 Now, move on to the next lesson.







=================================================================
=                         1.3 DELETION                          =
=================================================================

 Type the d key to delete the character under the cursor.

 1. Move the cursor to the line marked '-->' below.
 2. Move the cursor to each extra character, and type d to
    delete it.

 --> Thhiss senttencee haass exxtra charracterss.
     This sentence has extra characters.

 Once the sentence is correct, move on to the next lesson.








=================================================================
=                       1.4 INSERT MODE                         =
=================================================================

 Type the i key to enter Insert mode.

 1. Move the cursor to the line marked '-->' below.
 2. Move to a place in the line which is missing text and type
    i to enter Insert mode. Keys you type will now type text.
 3. Enter the missing text.
 4. Press Escape to exit Insert mode and return to Normal mode.
 5. Repeat until the line matches the line below it.

 --> Th stce misg so.
     This sentence is missing some text.

 Note: The status bar will display your current mode.
       Notice that when you type i, 'NOR' changes to 'INS'.




=================================================================
=                      1.5 SAVING A FILE                        =
=================================================================

 Type :w / :write to save a file.

 1. Exit Helix using :q! as explained before, or open a new
    terminal.
 2. Open a file in Helix by running: hx FILENAME
 3. Make some edits to the file.
 4. Type : to enter Command mode.
 5. Type w or write, and press Enter to save the file.

 You can also type wq or write-quit to save and exit.

 Note: You can optionally enter a filepath after the w / write
       command in order to save to that path.
 Note: If there are any unsaved changes to a file, a plus [+]
       will appear next to the file name in the status bar.



=================================================================
=                        CHAPTER 1 RECAP                        =
=================================================================

 * Use the h,j,k,l keys to move the cursor.

 * Type : to enter Command mode.
   * The q / quit and q! / quit! commands will exit Helix. The
     former fails when there are unsaved changes. The latter
     discards them.
   * The w / write command will save the file.
   * The wq / write-quit command will do both.

 * Type d to delete the character at the cursor.

 * Type i to enter Insert mode and type text. Press Escape to
   return to Normal mode.





=================================================================
=                   2.1 MORE INSERT COMMANDS                    =
=================================================================

 As you saw, you can type i to enter Insert mode at the current
 position of the cursor. There are a few other ways you can
 enter Insert mode at different locations.

 Common examples of insertion commands include:
   i - Insert before the selection.
   a - Insert after the selection. (a means 'append')
   I - Insert at the start of the line.
   A - Insert at the end of the line.

 1. Move to anywhere in the line marked '-->' below.
 2. Type A (Shift-a), your cursor will move to the end of
    the line and you will be able to type.
 3. Type the text necessary to match the line below.

 --> This sentence is miss
     This sentence is missing some text.

=================================================================
=                      2.2 OPENING LINES                        =
=================================================================

 Type o to add a newline and insert below the cursor.
 Type O to add a newline and insert above the cursor.

 1. Move the cursor to the line marked '-->' below.
 2. Type o to open a line below and type your answer.

 --> What is the best editor?











=================================================================
=                        CHAPTER 2 RECAP                        =
=================================================================

 * Type a to append to the selection.

 * Type I to enter Insert mode at the first non-whitespace
   character at the start of a line.

 * Type A to enter Insert mode at the end of a line.

 * Use o and O to open lines below and above the cursor respectively.










=================================================================
=                  3.1 MOTIONS AND SELECTIONS                   =
=================================================================

 Type w to select forward until the next word.

 The d key doesn't actually delete the character at the cursor,
 it deletes all selected text. Your cursor is like a
 single-character selection.

 1. Move the cursor to the line marked '-->' below.
 2. Move to the beginning of a word that needs to be deleted.
 3. Type w to select until the beginning of the next word.
 4. Type d to delete the selection.
 5. Repeat for all extra words in the line.

 --> This sentence pencil has vacuum extra words in the it.
     This sentence has extra words in it.




=================================================================
=                     3.2 MORE MOTIONS                          =
=================================================================

 As you saw, typing w moves the cursor forward until the start
 of the next word, selecting the text traversed. This is useful
 for moving around text and for selecting text to operate on.

 Some common motions include:
   w - Move forward to before the beginning of the next word.
   e - Move forward to the end of the current word.
   b - Move backward to the beginning of the current word.

 To select the word under cursor, combine e and b.

 1. Move the cursor to the line marked '-->' below.
 2. Move to a 'd' letter.
 3. Type e to select a half of the word.
 4. Type b to select the rest.

--> The Middle Kingdom.

=================================================================
=                     3.3 WORDS AND words                       =
=================================================================

 The w,e,b motions also have counterparts - W,E,B - which
 traverse WORDS instead of words. WORDS are only separated by
 whitespace, whereas words can be separated by other characters
 in addition to whitespace.

 1. Move the cursor to the beginning of the line marked with '-->'.
 2. Type w repeatedly to select individual words until you
    reach the end of the line.
 3. Note that 'one-of-a-kind' required 7 keystrokes to be
    traversed. '"modal"' required 3 keystrokes.
 4. Move the cursor back to beginning of the line marked '-->'.
 5. Type W repeatedly to select individual WORDS.
 6. Note that 'one-of-a-kind' and '"modal"' have been selected
    both with one keystroke each.

--> Helix is a one-of-a-kind "modal" text editor


=================================================================
=                    3.4 THE CHANGE COMMAND                     =
=================================================================

 Type c to change the current selection.

 The change command deletes the current selection and enters
 Insert mode, so it is a very common shorthand for di.

 1. Move the cursor to the line marked '-->' below.
 2. Move to the start of an incorrect word and type w to
    select it.
 3. Type c to delete the word and enter Insert mode.
 4. Type the correct word.
 5. Repeat until the line matches the line below it.

 --> This paper has heavy words behind it.
     This sentence has incorrect words in it.




=================================================================
=                   3.5 COUNTS WITH MOTIONS                     =
=================================================================

 Type a number before a motion to repeat it that many times.

 1. Move the cursor to the line marked '-->' below.
 2. Type 2w to move 2 words forward.
 3. Type 3e to move to the end of the third word forward.
 4. Type 2b to move 2 words backwards
 5. Try the above with different numbers.

 --> This is just a line with words you can move around in.









=================================================================
=                    3.6 SELECT / EXTEND MODE                   =
=================================================================

 Type v to enter Select mode.
 Type v again or Escape to return to Normal mode
 In Select mode every movement will extend the selection, as
 opposed to replacing it.

 1. Move the cursor to the line marked '-->' below.
 2. Move to the F of FOO and type v2w to select the two words.
 3. Type d to remove the two words. Notice d returns you to
    Normal mode.
 4. Move to the B of BAZ and repeat the sequence to delete them.

 --> Remove the FOO BAR distracting words BAZ BIZ from this line.






=================================================================
=                     3.7 SELECTING LINES                       =
=================================================================

 Type x to select a whole line. Type x again to select the next.

 1. Move the cursor to the second line marked '-->' below.
 2. Type x to select the line, and d to delete it.
 3. Move to the fourth line.
 4. Type x twice or type 2x to select 2 lines, and d to delete.

 --> 1) Roses are red,
 --> 2) Mud is fun,
 --> 3) Violets are blue,
 --> 4) I have a car,
 --> 5) Clocks tell time,
 --> 6) Sugar is sweet,
 --> 7) And so are you.

 Note : X works similarly to x although it doesn't extend to
      subsequent lines. X on an empty line does nothing.

=================================================================
=                   3.8 COLLAPSING SELECTIONS                   =
=================================================================

 Type ; to collapse selections to single cursors.

 Sometimes, you want to deselect without having to move the
 cursor(s). This can be done using the ; key.

 1. Move the cursor to the line marked '-->' below.
 2. Use the motions you have learned to move around the line,
    and try using ; to deselect the text after it is selected
    by the motions.

 --> This is an error-free line with words to move around in.

 Note: This works the same in Select mode.
 Note: Another related command is Alt-; which flips selections.




=================================================================
=                        CHAPTER 3 RECAP                        =
=================================================================

 * Type w to select forward until the next word.
   * Type e to select to the end of the current word.
   * Type b to select backward to the start of the current word.
   * Use uppercase counterparts, W,E,B, to traverse WORDS.

 * Type d to delete the entire selection.
   * Type c to delete the selection and enter Insert mode.

 * Type a number before a motion to repeat it that many times.

 * Type v to enter Select mode, where all motions extend the
   selection.

 * Type x to select the entire current line. Type x again to
   select the next line.

 * Type semicolon ( ; ) to collapse selection.

=================================================================
=                         4.1 UNDOING                           =
=================================================================

 Type u to undo. Type U to redo.

 1. Move the cursor to the line marked '-->' below.
 2. Move to the first error, and type d to delete it.
 3. Type u to undo your deletion.
 4. Fix all the errors on the line.
 5. Type u several times to undo your fixes.
 6. Type U (Shift-u) several times to redo your fixes.

 --> Fiix the errors on thhis line and reeplace them witth undo.








=================================================================
=                 4.2 COPYING AND PASTING TEXT                  =
=================================================================

 Type y to yank (copy) the selection.
 Type p to paste the yanked selection after the cursor.
 Type P to paste the yanked text before the cursor.

 1. Move the cursor to the line marked '-->' below.
    Make sure your cursor is on the "b" of banana.
 2. Type w to select "banana" and y to yank it.
 3. Move to the space between "2" and "3" and type p to paste.
 4. Repeat between "3" and "4".

 --> 1 banana 2 3 4
     1 banana 2 banana 3 banana 4

 Note: Whenever you delete or change text, Helix will copy the
       altered text. Use Alt-d / Alt-c instead to avoid this.
 Note: Helix doesn't share the system clipboard by default. Type
       Space + y / p to yank / paste on the system's clipboard.

=================================================================
=                     4.3 SEARCHING IN FILE                     =
=================================================================

 Type / to search forward in file, Enter to confirm search.
 Type n to go to the next search match.
 Type N to go to the previous search match.

 1. Type / and type in a common word, like 'banana'.
 2. Press Enter to confirm the search.
 3. Use n and N to cycle through the matches.

 Searching uses regular expressions, allowing you to target more
 complex expressions, which you'll learn about in the lesson on
 the select command.

 Note: To search backwards, type ? (Shift-/).
 Note: Unlike Vim, ? doesn't change the search direction.
       N always goes backwards and n always goes forwards.



=================================================================
=                        CHAPTER 4 RECAP                        =
=================================================================

 * Type u to undo. Type U to redo.

 * Type y to yank (copy) text and p to paste.
   * Use Space + y and Space + p to yank / paste on the system
     clipboard.

 * Type / to search forward in file, and ? to search backwards.
   * Use n and N to cycle through search matches.










=================================================================
=                     5.1 MULTIPLE CURSORS                      =
=================================================================

 Type C to duplicate the cursor to the next suitable line.

 1. Move the cursor to the first line marked '-->' below. Place
    the cursor somewhere past the '-->'.
 2. Type C to duplicate the cursor to the next suitable line.
    Notice how it skips the line in the middle. Keys you type
    will now affect both cursors.
 3. Use Insert mode to correct the lines. The two cursors will
    fix both lines simultaneously.
 4. Type , to remove the second cursor.

 --> Fix th two nes at same ime.
 -->
 --> Fix th two nes at same ime.
     Fix these two lines at the same time.

 Note: Press Alt-C to do the same above the cursor.

=================================================================
=                    5.2 THE SELECT COMMAND                     =
=================================================================

 Type s to select matches in the selection.

 1. Move the cursor to the line marked '-->' below.
 2. Type x to select the line.
 3. Type s. A prompt will appear.
 4. Type 'apples' and press Enter. Both occurrences of
    'apples' in the line will be selected.
 5. You can now type c and change 'apples' to something else,
    like 'oranges'.
 6. Press Escape to exit Insert mode.
 7. Type , to remove the second cursor.

 --> I like to eat apples since my favorite fruit is apples.
     I like to eat oranges since my favorite fruit is oranges.




=================================================================
=                    5.3 SELECTING VIA REGEX                    =
=================================================================

 Like searching, the select command selects regular expressions,
 not just exact matches.

 1. Move the cursor to the line marked '-->' below.
 2. Select the line with x and then type s.
 3. Type '  +' to select any amount of consecutive spaces >1,
    then press Enter.
 4. Type c and change the matches to single spaces.

 --> This  sentence has   some      extra spaces.
     This sentence has some extra spaces.

 Note: If you want to perform find-and-replace, the select
       command is the way to do it. Select the text you want
       to replace in — type % to select the whole file — and
       then perform the steps explained above.


=================================================================
=                      5.4 ALIGN SELECTIONS                     =
=================================================================

 Type & to align the contents of the selections.

 1. Move the cursor to the first line marked '-->' below. Place
    the cursor on the whitespace just after the arrow.

 Note: & only cares about the alignment of the "head" of the
       selections - the end that moves. The other end is called
       the "anchor".

=================================================================
=                 5.5 SPLIT SELECTION INTO LINES                =

=================================================================

 Registers are containers identified by a character for storing
 things like yanked text. Registers are also used to store the
 most recent search term as well as macros, which you'll learn
 about in the next section.

 Type "<ch> to select register <ch>.

 1. Move the cursor to the line marked '-->' below.
 2. Type w to select "watermelons" and yank with y.

=================================================================

 Macros are a way to record a set of actions you want to repeat.
 You can also record macros to a specific register (default @).
 Type Q to start recording a macro - you should see a popup at
 the bottom of your screen. Type Q again to stop recording.
 Type q to repeat the macro from register @ (the default).

=                  9.1 SEARCHING FOR SELECTIONS                 =
=================================================================

 The most recent search with / is stored in register /.
 n and N both refer to register /, this means we can set that
 register without having to type in a search.

 Type * to copy the selection into register /, setting the search
 term to the selection. This copies the primary selection, which
 you will learn about in the section on cycling selections.

 1. Move the cursor to the line marked '-->' below.
 2. Select "horse" with e and type *.
 3. Use n and N to jump between the instances of "horse".

 --> A horse is a horse, of course, of course,
 --> And no one can talk to a horse of course.

 Note: * is like a shorthand for "/ y as all it really does is
       copy the selection into the / register.

=================================================================
=           9.2 ADDING SELECTION ON NEXT SEARCH MATCH           =
=================================================================

 A property of Select mode (v) when using n and N is that instead
 of moving the selection to the next match, it adds a new
 selection on each match.

 1. Move the cursor to the line marked '-->' below.
 2. Select the first "bat" and type * to set it to search.
 3. Type v to enter Select mode.
 4. Type n to select the other "bat".
 5. Use c or r to change the "bat"s to "cat".

 --> Everybody wants to be a bat,
 --> because a cat's the only bat
 --> who knows where it's at.

=================================================================

 Type S to split each selection on a regex pattern.

 1. Move the cursor to the line under ---.
 2. Type xx / 2x to select the lines.
 3. Type S then \. |! Enter (note the spaces after . and !).
    This effectively splits the selection into sentences at each
    dot or exclamation mark.
 4. Press Alt-; to reverse the selections.
 5. Type ; to reduce selections to a single character - the first
    letter of each sentence.
 6. Press Alt-` to convert all selected letters to uppercase.
