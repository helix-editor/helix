# The structure is based on `base16_default_dark` by Ray Gervais.  Most of
# the colors come from the so called Autumn theme, a color scheme inspired by
# the colors you can find in the autumn. Originally it was designed as a
# color scheme for the Komodo IDE and then ported to Vim by Kenneth Love
# and Chris Jones. Later, Yorick Peterse improved their work. See:
# <https://github.com/YorickPeterse/Autumn.vim>
# Jens Getreu ported and optimised the color theme for the Helix editor.
