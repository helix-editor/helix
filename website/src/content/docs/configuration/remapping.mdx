import Master from "@/components/Master.astro";

Helix currently supports one-way key remapping through a simple TOML configuration
file. (More powerful solutions such as rebinding via commands will be
available in the future).

There are three kinds of commands that can be used in keymaps:

## Types of Commands

### Static Commands

Commands like `move_char_right` which are usually bound to keys and used for movement and editing.

A list of static commands is available in the [Keymap](/reference/keymap) documentation and in the source code in [`helix-term/src/commands.rs`](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/blob/master/helix-term/src/commands.rs)

### Typable Commands

Commands that can be executed from command mode (`:`), for example `:write!`.

See the [Typed Commands](/reference/typed-commands) documentation for a list of available typeable commands.

Also available at `TypableCommandList` declaration in the source code at [`helix-term/src/commands/typed.rs`](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/blob/master/helix-term/src/commands/typed.rs).

### Macros

Sequences of keys that are executed in order.

These keybindings start with `@` and then list any number of keys to be executed.

For example `@miw` can be used to select the surrounding word.

```toml
# helix/config.toml
W = "@miw";
```

For now, macro keybindings are not allowed in keybinding sequences due to limitations in the way that command sequences are executed.

:::note

Modifier keys (e.g. Alt+o) can be used like `"<A-o>"`, e.g. `"@miw<A-o>"`

## Remapping

To remap keys, create a `config.toml` file in your `helix` configuration
directory (default `~/.config/helix` on Linux systems) with a structure like
this:

:::tip

To set a modifier + key as a keymap, type `A-X = ...` or `C-X = ...` for Alt + X or Ctrl + X. Combine with Shift using a dash, e.g. `C-S-esc`.

Within macros, wrap them in `<>`, e.g. `<A-X>` and `<C-X>` to distinguish from the `A` or `C` keys.

:::

### Example

```toml
# At most one section each of 'keys.normal', 'keys.insert' and 'keys.select'
[keys.normal]
# Maps Ctrl-s to the typable command :w which is an alias for :write (save file)
C-s = ":w"

# Maps Ctrl-o to opening of the helix config file
C-o = ":config-open"

# Maps the 'a' key to the move_char_left command
a = "move_char_left"

# Maps the 'w' key move_line_up
w = "move_line_up"

# Maps Ctrl-Shift-Escape to extend_line
"C-S-esc" = "extend_line"

# Maps `ga` to show possible code actions
g = { a = "code_action" }

 # Maps the enter key to open_below then re-enter normal mode
"ret" = ["open_below", "normal_mode"]

# Maps Alt-x to a macro selecting the whole line and deleting it without yanking it
"A-x" = "@x<A-d>"

[keys.insert]
# Maps Alt-X to enter normal mode
"A-x" = "normal_mode"

# Maps `jk` to exit insert mode
j = { k = "normal_mode" }
```

## Minor modes

Minor modes are accessed by pressing a key (usually from normal mode), giving access to dedicated bindings.

Bindings can be modified or added by nesting definitions.

```toml
[keys.insert.j]
# Maps `jk` to exit insert mode
k = "normal_mode"

[keys.normal.g]
# Maps `ga` to show possible code actions
a = "code_action"

# invert `j` and `k` in view mode
[keys.normal.z]
j = "scroll_up"
k = "scroll_down"

# create a new minor mode bound to `+`
[keys.normal."+"]
m = ":run-shell-command make"
c = ":run-shell-command cargo build"
t = ":run-shell-command cargo test"
```

## Special keys and modifiers

Ctrl, Shift and Alt modifiers are encoded respectively with the prefixes
`C-`, `S-` and `A-`. Special keys are encoded as follows:

| Key name                              | Representation |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| <kbd>Backspace</kbd>                  | `"backspace"`  |
| <kbd>Space</kbd>                      | `"space"`      |
| <kbd>Return</kbd> or <kbd>Enter</kbd> | `"ret"`        |
| <kbd>-</kbd>                          | `"minus"`      |
| <kbd>Left</kbd>                       | `"left"`       |
| <kbd>Right</kbd>                      | `"right"`      |
| <kbd>Up</kbd>                         | `"up"`         |
| <kbd>Down</kbd>                       | `"down"`       |
| <kbd>Home</kbd>                       | `"home"`       |
| <kbd>End</kbd>                        | `"end"`        |
| <kbd>Page Up</kbd>                    | `"pageup"`     |
| <kbd>Page Down</kbd>                  | `"pagedown"`   |
| <kbd>Tab</kbd>                        | `"tab"`        |
| <kbd>Delete</kbd>                     | `"del"`        |
| <kbd>Insert</kbd>                     | `"ins"`        |
| <kbd>Null</kbd>                       | `"null"`       |
| <kbd>Escape</kbd>                     | `"esc"`        |

Other keys such as `/`, `+` and `?` can be referenced literally.

:::tip

Keys can be disabled by binding them to the `no_op` command.
