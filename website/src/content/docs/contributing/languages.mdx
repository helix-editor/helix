description: Adding syntax highlighting and language server support for new languages in Helix
pagefind: false
---

In order to add a new language to Helix, you will need to follow the steps
below.

## Language configuration

1. Add a new `[[language]]` entry in the `languages.toml` file and provide the
   necessary configuration for the new language. For more information on
   language configuration, refer to the
   [language configuration section](/configuration/languages) of the documentation.
   A new language server can be added by extending the `[language-server]` table in the same file.
2. If you are adding a new language or updating an existing language server
   configuration, run the command `cargo xtask docgen` to update the
   [Language Support](/help/language-defaults) documentation.

:::note

If you are adding a new Language Server configuration, make sure to update
the [Language Server Wiki](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/wiki/Language-Server-Configurations) with the installation instructions.

## Grammar configuration

1. If a tree-sitter grammar is available for the new language, add a new
   `[[grammar]]` entry to the `languages.toml` file.
2. If you are testing the grammar locally, you can use the `source.path` key
   with an absolute path to the grammar. However, before submitting a pull
   request, make sure to switch to using `source.git`.

## Queries

1. In order to provide syntax highlighting and indentation for the new language,
   you will need to add queries.
2. Create a new directory for the language with the path
   `runtime/queries/<name>/`.
3. Refer to the
   [tree-sitter website](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/syntax-highlighting#queries)
   for more information on writing queries.
4. A list of highlight captures can be found [on the themes page](https://docs.helix-editor.com/themes.html#scopes).

:::note

In Helix, the first matching query takes precedence when evaluating
queries, which is different from other editors such as Neovim where the last
matching query supersedes the ones before it. See
[this issue](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/pull/1170#issuecomment-997294090) for an example.

## Common issues

- If you encounter errors when running Helix after switching branches, you may
  need to update the tree-sitter grammars. Run the command `hx --grammar fetch`
  to fetch the grammars and `hx --grammar build` to build any out-of-date
  grammars.
- If a parser is causing a segfault, or you want to remove it, make sure to
  remove the compiled parser located at `runtime/grammars/<name>.so`.
- If you are attempting to add queries and Helix is unable to locate them, ensure that the environment variable `HELIX_RUNTIME` is set to the location of the `runtime` folder you're developing in.
