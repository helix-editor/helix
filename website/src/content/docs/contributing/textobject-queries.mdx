Helix supports textobjects that are language specific, such as functions, classes, etc.
These textobjects require an accompanying tree-sitter grammar and a `textobjects.scm` query file
to work properly. Tree-sitter allows us to query the source code syntax tree
and capture specific parts of it. The queries are written in a lisp dialect.
More information on how to write queries can be found in the [official tree-sitter
documentation][tree-sitter-queries].

Query files should be placed in `runtime/queries/{language}/textobjects.scm`
when contributing to Helix. Note that to test the query files locally you should put
them under your local runtime directory (`~/.config/helix/runtime` on Linux
for example).

The following [captures][tree-sitter-captures] are recognized:

- `function.inside`
- `function.around`
- `class.inside`
- `class.around`
- `test.inside`
- `test.around`
- `parameter.inside`
- `comment.inside`
- `comment.around`
- `entry.inside`
- `entry.around`

[Example query files][textobject-examples] can be found in the helix GitHub repository.

## Queries for textobject based navigation

Tree-sitter based navigation in Helix is done using captures in the
following order:

- `object.movement`
- `object.around`
- `object.inside`

For example if a `function.around` capture has been already defined for a language
in its `textobjects.scm` file, function navigation should also work automatically.
`function.movement` should be defined only if the node captured by `function.around`
doesn't make sense in a navigation context.
